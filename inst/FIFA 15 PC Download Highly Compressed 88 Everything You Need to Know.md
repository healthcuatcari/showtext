Palisade @RISK 5.7 is a software that allows you to perform risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation in Excel. It can help you to quantify the uncertainty and variability in your models, and to evaluate the impact of different scenarios and decisions.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use Palisade @RISK 5.7 for a simple risk analysis example. We will use the Quick Start model that is bundled with the software, which is based on a real-life case study of a construction project.

## Step 1: Define the Inputs and Outputs
 
The first step in risk analysis is to identify the inputs and outputs of your model. Inputs are the uncertain factors that affect your model, such as costs, revenues, demand, etc. Outputs are the results or outcomes that you want to measure, such as profit, return on investment, etc.
 
In Palisade @RISK 5.7, you can define the inputs and outputs using the Define Distributions and Define Output dialogs. For example, in the Quick Start model, the inputs are the construction cost, the sales price per unit, and the number of units sold. The output is the net present value (NPV) of the project.
 
## Step 2: Assign Probability Distributions to the Inputs
 
The next step is to assign probability distributions to the inputs, which represent the range and likelihood of possible values for each input. Palisade @RISK 5.7 has a library of over 40 probability distributions that you can choose from, such as normal, uniform, triangular, etc.
 
In Palisade @RISK 5.7, you can assign probability distributions to the inputs using the Define Distributions dialog or the Insert Function wizard. For example, in the Quick Start model, the construction cost is assigned a normal distribution with a mean of $14 million and a standard deviation of $1 million.
 
## Step 3: Run the Simulation
 
The third step is to run the simulation, which generates random values for each input according to their probability distributions, and calculates the output for each iteration. Palisade @RISK 5.7 allows you to run simulations with different settings, such as number of iterations, sampling method, random seed, etc.
 
In Palisade @RISK 5.7, you can run simulations using the Start Simulation button or the Simulation Settings dialog. For example, in the Quick Start model, we can run a simulation with 10,000 iterations and Latin Hypercube sampling.
 
## Step 4: Analyze the Results
 
The final step is to analyze the results of the simulation, which show you the distribution and statistics of the output, as well as other useful information such as sensitivity analysis, scenario analysis, tornado charts, etc. Palisade @RISK 5.7 provides various tools and graphs for analyzing the results.

In Palisade @RISK 5.7, you can analyze the results using the Browse Results button or the Results Summary window. For example, in the Quick Start model, we can see that the NPV has a mean of $3.8 million and a standard deviation of $1.9 million. We can also see that the most influential input is the sales price per unit.
 
### Conclusion
 
Palisade @RISK 5.7 is a powerful software that can help you to perform risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation in Excel. It can help you to understand and manage the uncertainty and variability in your models, and to make better decisions based on data and probabilities.
