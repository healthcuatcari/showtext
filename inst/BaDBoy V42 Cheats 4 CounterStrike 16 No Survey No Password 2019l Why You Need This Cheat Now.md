We also want to support you in complying with the policies that ensure a safe and trustworthy ecosystem for everyone. That's why we have introduced some new initiatives to help you understand and follow the rules more easily. These include expanding the Developer Helpline program, where you can talk to a real person about any policy compliance issues you may have, and launching a Strike Removal program, where you can request to remove a strike from your account if you learn from your mistake and fix the problem. We also provide more guidance and education on the most common policy areas that developers struggle with, such as intellectual property, privacy, and content ratings.
  
We hope these initiatives will help you navigate trust and safety on Google Play more smoothly and confidently. We also want to hear from you about your experiences and feedback on how we can improve our policies and processes. You can share your thoughts with us through the Developer Feedback Survey, which will be available in the Play Console soon.
