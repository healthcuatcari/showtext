Multiplayer mode is where the game truly shines, as you can test your skills and strategies against other human opponents. However, multiplayer mode can also be challenging and frustrating, especially for beginners who may not know how to play effectively. In this article, we will give you some tips and tricks on how to master multiplayer mode in Company of Heroes 2.
 
## Know Your Faction
 
The first step to mastering multiplayer mode is to know your faction and its capabilities. Each faction has its own playstyle, advantages and disadvantages, and unique units and abilities. For example, the Soviet faction is more suited for aggressive and mobile warfare, while the German faction is more defensive and relies on heavy armor and artillery. You should familiarize yourself with the units and abilities of your faction, as well as their costs and requirements. You should also know the strengths and weaknesses of your opponent's faction, so you can counter their moves and exploit their vulnerabilities.
 
## Manage Your Resources
 
The second step to mastering multiplayer mode is to manage your resources efficiently. Resources are essential for building units, structures, upgrades, and abilities. There are three types of resources in Company of Heroes 2: manpower, fuel, and munitions. Manpower is used for infantry units and basic structures, fuel is used for vehicles and advanced structures, and munitions are used for upgrades and abilities. You can gain resources by capturing and holding resource points on the map. You should always try to secure as many resource points as possible, especially fuel points, as they are crucial for gaining a technological edge over your enemy. You should also avoid wasting resources on unnecessary units or structures, or losing them to enemy attacks.
 
## Control the Map
 
The third step to mastering multiplayer mode is to control the map and its strategic points. The map is divided into sectors that can be captured by infantry units. Capturing sectors grants you access to resources and vision of the area. However, capturing sectors also makes them vulnerable to enemy attacks, so you need to defend them with units or structures. You should also pay attention to the victory points on the map, which are marked with stars. Controlling victory points reduces your enemy's victory point count, which can lead to a win by points if they reach zero. You should always try to control at least two out of three victory points, while denying your enemy access to them.
 
## Use Cover and Line of Sight
 
The fourth step to mastering multiplayer mode is to use cover and line of sight effectively. Cover and line of sight are two important mechanics that affect the combat performance of your units. Cover is indicated by yellow or green icons above your units, which show how well they are protected from enemy fire. Yellow cover means light cover, which reduces incoming damage by 25%, while green cover means heavy cover, which reduces incoming damage by 50%. You should always try to position your units in cover whenever possible, especially when facing enemy fire or artillery. Line of sight is indicated by a cone-shaped area in front of your units, which shows what they can see and shoot at. Line of sight can be blocked by terrain features, buildings, smoke screens, or blizzards. You should always try to maintain line of sight on your enemy units while avoiding being seen by them.
 
## Use Combined Arms
 
The fifth step to mastering multiplayer mode is to use combined arms tactics. Combined arms means using different types of units together to support each other and create a more effective force. For example, you can use infantry units to capture sectors and provide vision for your vehicles or artillery units, which can then provide fire support for your infantry units. You can also use different types of infantry units together to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. For example, you can use engineers or pioneers to repair your vehicles or lay mines or barbed wire, while using riflemen or grenadiers to engage enemy infantry or anti-tank
