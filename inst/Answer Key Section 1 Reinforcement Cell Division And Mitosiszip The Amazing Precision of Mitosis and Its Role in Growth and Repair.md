<h1>Answer Key Section 1 Reinforcement Cell Division And Mitosiszip</h1>
<p>Cell division is the process by which a cell splits into two identical daughter cells. Mitosis is a type of cell division that occurs in somatic cells (non-sex cells) and produces two diploid cells (cells with two sets of chromosomes). In this article, we will review the key concepts and steps of mitosis and provide an answer key for a worksheet that tests your knowledge of this topic.</p>

<h2>The Phases of Mitosis</h2>
<p>Mitosis consists of four main phases: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. Each phase has specific events that occur in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of the cell.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prophase:</strong> The chromosomes condense and become visible as X-shaped structures. Each chromosome consists of two identical sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The nuclear envelope breaks down and the nucleolus disappears. The centrosomes (organelles that contain centrioles) move to opposite poles of the cell and form spindle fibers that attach to the chromosomes.</li>
<li><strong>Metaphase:</strong> The chromosomes align at the equator of the cell, forming the metaphase plate. The spindle fibers pull on the chromosomes and ensure that they are properly oriented.</li>
<li><strong>Anaphase:</strong> The sister chromatids separate at the centromere and move to opposite poles of the cell. Each chromatid is now considered a chromosome. The cell elongates as the spindle fibers push the poles apart.</li>
<li><strong>Telophase:</strong> The chromosomes reach the poles and decondense. The nuclear envelope reforms around each set of chromosomes and the nucleolus reappears. The spindle fibers disassemble and the cell prepares to divide.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Cytokinesis</h2>
<p>Cytokinesis is the division of the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane that occurs after mitosis. Cytokinesis differs in animal and plant cells.</p>

<li><strong>Animal cells:</strong> A cleavage furrow forms at the equator of the cell and pinches inward until the cell splits into two.</li>
<li><strong>Plant cells:</strong> A cell plate forms at the equator of the cell and grows outward until it fuses with the plasma membrane and forms a new cell wall.</li>
