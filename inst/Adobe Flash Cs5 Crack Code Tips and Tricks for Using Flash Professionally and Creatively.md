1. Select the Text tool from the toolbar. Click on the stage and type "Greetings from Adobe Flash CS5". You can adjust the font size, color, and alignment using the Properties panel.
2. Select the Rectangle tool from the toolbar. Click and drag on the stage to draw a rectangle around the text. You can change the fill color, stroke color, and stroke width using the Properties panel.
3. Select both the text and the rectangle using the Selection tool. Right-click on them and choose Convert to Symbol. In the Convert to Symbol dialog box, name the symbol "Card", select Movie Clip as the type, and click OK. This will create a reusable symbol that contains both the text and the rectangle.
4. Drag the Card symbol from the Library panel to the center of the stage. You can resize and reposition it using the Free Transform tool.

## Use components to create user interface elements
 
Components are prebuilt user interface elements that you can use in your Flash projects, such as buttons, sliders, lists, etc. You can find components in the Components panel, and drag them to the stage.
 
To use components to create user interface elements, follow these steps:

1. In the Components panel, select a TextArea component and drag it to the stage. This will create a text area where users can type their own message.
2. In the Properties panel, give the TextArea component an instance name of "message\_txt". This will allow you to refer to it in code later.
3. In the Components panel, select a Button component and drag it to the stage. This will create a button that users can click to send their message.
4. In the Properties panel, give the Button component an instance name of "send\_btn". Also change its label property to "Send".

## Add interactivity with code
 
To add interactivity with code, you need to use ActionScript 3.0, which is a scripting language that allows you to control your Flash content. You can write ActionScript code in the Actions panel, which is where you can access various classes, methods, properties, events, etc.
 
To add interactivity with code, follow these steps:

1. Select Window > Actions to open the Actions panel. This is where you will write your code.
2. Click on an empty frame in the timeline (for example, frame 1) and write this code in the Actions panel:

```actionscript
//This code will add an event listener to the send button
//When users click on it 8cf37b1e13
