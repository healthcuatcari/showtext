Zombie Invasion! includes four different decorations that you can choose from or combine for a full-scale zombie apocalypse. You can display them on any surface using a projector, a DVD player, and a projection material. Here are the four decorations and how to use them:
 
- **Zombie Breach**: This decoration shows zombies smashing through plaster walls and boarded-up windows. You can project it onto your walls or windows using Window Projection Material or Hollusion Projection Material[^1^].
- **Zombie Swarm**: This decoration shows a swarm of zombies gathering outside your window, trying to break through the glass. You can project it onto your windows using Window Projection Material[^1^], or display it on your TV or monitor for a more up-close and personal horror[^2^].
- **Zombie Attack**: This decoration shows an unlucky victim being overwhelmed by a zombie attack. You can project it onto your walls or windows using Window Projection Material or Hollusion Projection Material[^1^], or display it on your TV or monitor for a more gruesome effect[^2^].
- **Zombie Invasion! Decoration Collection**: This option gives you all four decorations for a discounted price. You can mix and match them to create your own unique zombie invasion scenario.

To get started, you will need to download the digital decorations from the AtmosFX website[^3^], or buy the DVD from their online store or other retailers. You will also need a projector, a DVD player, and a projection material. You can find more information on how to set up your digital decorations on the AtmosFX website, or watch their tutorial videos on YouTube.
 
With AtmosFEARfx Digital Decorations, you can turn your home into a zombie-infested nightmare that will impress and terrify your visitors.

If you want to take your zombie invasion to the next level, you can also use some props and accessories to enhance the effect. For example, you can use the AtmosFX 3DFX Form to create a three-dimensional zombie that you can project onto. You can also use fake blood, body parts, signs, or other items to create a more realistic and immersive scene. You can find some ideas and inspiration from the AtmosFX Hall of Fame, where you can see how other people have used their digital decorations in creative ways.
