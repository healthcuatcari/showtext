DTS Neural UpMix VST RTAS v1.0.4 uses a patented algorithm that spectrally separates individual audio elements and places them in their intended location within the surround environment[^2^]. This results in unparalleled image placement and stability, preserving the artistic integrity of the content[^2^]. The plugin can also decode matrix-encoded Lt/RT stereo signals and provide a high quality surround sound image that is more stable than that of traditional matrix decoders[^2^].
 
DTS Neural UpMix VST RTAS v1.0.4 is compatible with all stereo signals, including matrix encoded Lt/Rt signals[^2^]. It also features adaptive filters that eliminate "dialog leakage" traditionally found in matrix audio decoders[^2^]. The plugin can be used as an end-to-end surround delivery system when combined with the Neural Surround DownMix, which can restore stereo signals encoded and downmixed using the UpMix to a near-discrete 5.1 surround sound experience[^2^].
 
DTS Neural UpMix VST RTAS v1.0.4 is a versatile and powerful plugin that can enhance your audio production with surround sound conversion. It is suitable for various applications, such as sports trucks, network ingest points, production studios, confidence monitoring, DTV and digital radio facilities[^2^]. If you want to create a more engaging and realistic sound experience for your listeners, you should try DTS Neural UpMix VST RTAS v1.0.4 today.
